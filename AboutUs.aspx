        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="fs-22 fw-100" style="text-align:justify">Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archaeology is a centre of learning of the discipline of Archaeology and its allied disciplines like Epigraphy, Numismatics, Iconography, Museology, etc. flourishing under the aegis of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for decades.
</p>
     <h2>History of the Institute</h2>
            <p class="fs-22 fw-100" style="text-align:justify">Beginning from the idea of a School of Archaeology under the ASI in 1944 to its formal establishment in 1959 and later to the up gradation from school to an Institute in 1985, it took several decades to attain its present form. This long enduring process was a result of cumulative efforts of visionary scholars and former DGs of ASI like Sir Mortimer Wheeler, Padmashri Late Amalananda Ghosh, Padmashri B.B. Lal and many more.
	<br><br>Later, in 2019, the name of this Institute of Archaeology changed to Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archaeology in order to commemorate the great leader.
</p>
        <br>
        <h2> Salient Features of the Pt. DUIA Campus:</h2>
        <p class="fs-22 fw-100" style="text-align:justify"> The twenty-five acre campus is based on the ancient principles of Vastu Shastra. It is almost square in geometry and includes a Brahmsthan in the centre. The main building has been placed on the south side. The campus is designed on the principles of green building architecture accompanied by energy-efficient practices like use of solar energy and water conservation practices with several safety features and universal accessibility.
	<br><br>Some of the noteworthy Architectural features of the five-floor high main building with stepped pyramidal crown includes a central skylight atrium and grand broken arches, chattris, motifs, arches and floors with geometric patterns and which establishes a strong connection with archaeology that invokes the past and transport the visitors into a themed environment steeped in history.
</p>
        <h2>Present Scenario:</h2>
        <p class="fs-22 fw-100" style="text-align:justify">At present, the Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archaeology conducts Post Graduate Diploma in Archaeology for national & even international students. In addition to Lectures by experts, it also conducts professional workshops in the field of Structural and Chemical Conservation, Heritage and Environmental Management, Epigraphy, Numismatics, Museology & Administration. It also conducts Excavation & Exploration and All India Tours of the monuments/sites of National Importance every year for enhancing the practical knowledge base of its students. Besides this, being an organic institution, it provides training to the in-service personnel time to time as part of the capacity building measures of ASI.
<br><br>Along with the ASI office, there is a library and a Gallery dedicated to Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya along with space for restoration of artefacts, and a proper zone for archival.
